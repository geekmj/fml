# Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with our peers, we decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist agents and their clients with finding the best selling price for their home. 

We have used Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. 

We build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. Than this model is used to estimate the best selling price for agents clients' homes.
