# Project - Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

In this project, we have investigates a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We learned little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task. We then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of our hypotheses.

## Important of this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows us to investigate data and make inferences based on our observations. A foundation in statistics also allows us to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows us to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## What I learn?

This project review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

* How to identify components of an experiment
* How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
